## Set Up the JDK

You need the Java Development Kit (JDK) from Oracle to compile Java apps on your machine. 

First check to see if you already have the JDK. Open Terminal or Command Prompt and type `java -version`. If you have the JDK, the response should be something like this:

```
java version "1.8.0_101"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_101-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.101-b13, mixed mode)
```

If you don't have the JDK, download the version of the JDK Installer for your machine from [Java SE Development Kit Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and run it. 

For more details, see the following: 

* [10 JDK 8 Installation for OS X](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html)
* [JDK Installation for Microsoft Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/windows_jdk_install.html). Specifically, see "Running the JDK Installer" and "Updating the PATH Environment Variable."

For other operating systems and information, see [JDK 8 and JRE 8 Installation Start Here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html).

## Set Up Android Studio {#setupandroidstudio}

See [Getting Started with Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html)Â and [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html) for information about setting up the Android Studio development environment on your machine.

## Next Steps
