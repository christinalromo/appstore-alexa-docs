*  [Image Guidelines for Amazon Appstore Submission][asset-guidelines-for-app-submission]: Your app submission includes icons and screen shots. This page describes the guidelines for those media assets.
* [Getting Started with Device Targeting][getting-started-with-device-targeting]: If you’ve developed your app for multiple platforms or devices (for example, for Kindle Fire tablets and for Amazon Fire TV devices), device targeting enables you to submit that app once and provide multiple binary APKs.
