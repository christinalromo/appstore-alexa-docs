The remote for [Fire TV Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDC9RBJ) has some additional buttons &mdash; volume up/down, power, Netflix, Amazon Music, and Amazon Prime. However, these buttons can't be mapped to events in third-party apps, so the buttons shown in the above Fire TV remote are effectively the same available buttons for Fire TV Edition's remote, even if the remotes look a bit different.
